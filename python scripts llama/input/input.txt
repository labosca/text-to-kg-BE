The premises covered by this preliminary study belong to the 19th century building known as the Palace of Anatomical Institutes, which occupies a block included between Corso Massimo d' Azeglio and Via Gaetano Donizetti, Via Pietro Giuria and Via Michelangelo Buonarroti in the City of Turin. 
It is owned by the University of Turin.
In addition to being a university building, the palace is home to the Sistema Museale di Ateneo, and currently hosts the Museum of Human Anatomy, the Museum of Criminal Anthropology and the Museum of Fruits, and in the future the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography and the Museum of Man, which have not yet opened to the public.
The Palace of the Anatomical Institutes has four levels with three above-ground floors and a basement. 
The Ground Floor (floor code 039_A_P00) has four main entrances (one on each side) with the Gaetano Donizetti Street entrance crossing the open courtyard facing southwest.
